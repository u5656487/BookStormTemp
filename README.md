1. Try to use **Spring + Mybatis + SpringMVC** to generate a *Java Web Project* for the first time. Remain some bugs, fix them if have spare time later. Hope any senior can point out any exiting problems which need to amend genuinely. Appreciate at lot. 
 
 
2. Using MySQL, the database is in the **config** folder.

3. I use svn in this project, the coding format is *gbk*, so there exits some random codes.
